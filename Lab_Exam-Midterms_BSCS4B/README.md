This midterm exam demonstrates how an Arduino can monitor environmental light levels using a photoresistor and respond by controlling multiple LEDs. The system represents light intensity visually through green, yellow, and red LEDs, simulating conditions such as low, normal, and high brightness. Light values are read continuously and converted into percentage form to make the output easier to understand.

The program supports two operating modes: manual and automatic. In automatic mode, the Arduino uses preset threshold values to decide which LED should turn on based on the detected light level. This mode also provides a simple interpretation of the environment, such as cloudy, normal, or bright sunlight. In manual mode, the user can adjust the threshold values through serial commands, allowing greater control over how the LEDs respond to changes in light.

Serial communication plays an important role in this activity by enabling mode switching, threshold adjustment, and real-time monitoring of system status. Overall, this activity highlights sensor integration, decision-based LED control, and user interaction through serial commands, making it a practical example of an adaptive embedded system.
