This folder contains the second laboratory activity for COSC-111, which builds on the previous LED control exercise by introducing brightness control. In this activity, multiple LEDs are connected to the Arduino and controlled using pulse-width modulation (PWM) to vary their brightness. Each LED lights up with a specific brightness level, pauses for a short delay, and then turns off before the next LED is activated.

The program uses arrays to store both the LED pin numbers and their corresponding brightness values, making the code more organized and easier to manage. By combining loops with analog output, this activity demonstrates how LEDs can be controlled not just in an on-and-off manner but also with different intensity levels. This exercise helps reinforce the use of arrays, looping logic, and timing while introducing basic concepts of PWM and gradual output control in Arduino programming.
