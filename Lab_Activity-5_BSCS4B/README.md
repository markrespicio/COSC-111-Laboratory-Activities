This activity demonstrates how an Arduino and a Python program can communicate with each other using serial communication to control hardware components. In this setup, Python acts as the controller by sending simple text commands to the Arduino, while the Arduino responds by turning LEDs on or off based on the received input. The activity focuses on understanding how software running on a computer can interact with a microcontroller in real time.

On the Arduino side, the program listens continuously for incoming serial data sent from Python. Each character received corresponds to a specific action, such as toggling the red, green, or blue LED, turning all LEDs on, or turning them all off. The LED control logic is separated into a header file to keep the main program organized and easier to understand. This structure helps demonstrate modular programming and proper code organization in Arduino projects.

The Python program provides a simple menu-based interface that allows the user to choose which LED action to perform. When a command is selected, Python sends a single character through the serial port to the Arduino. The Arduino then processes the command and updates the LED states accordingly. This activity helps illustrate the basics of serial communication, cross-language interaction, and real-time hardware control, making it a practical example of integrating Python with embedded systems.
