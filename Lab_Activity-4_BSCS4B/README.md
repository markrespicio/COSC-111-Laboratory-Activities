This folder contains a laboratory activity for COSC-111 that uses a photoresistor to control an LED based on light intensity. In this activity, the Arduino continuously reads brightness values from the photoresistor and compares them to a set threshold. When the detected light level reaches or exceeds the threshold, the LED begins to blink as an indicator.

The program also introduces basic interaction through the Serial Monitor. Users can monitor real-time brightness readings and stop the system by typing a command, which turns off the LED and halts the program’s operation. This activity helps demonstrate how sensor input, conditional logic, and serial communication can work together in an Arduino project, while reinforcing the idea of making simple automated responses based on environmental conditions.
