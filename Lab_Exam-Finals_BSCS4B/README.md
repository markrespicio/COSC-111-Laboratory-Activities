This project demonstrates remote control of an Arduino device using an HTTP-based API.
A local Arduino setup with a push button sends a signal to a Python application, which then calls an API hosted by the instructor. The API controls the instructor’s Arduino, causing an LED to toggle remotely.

This implementation simulates a real-world IoT architecture, where a physical device interacts with another remote device through software and network communication.
