This folder contains the third laboratory activity for COSC-111, which focuses on using a fire sensor with an Arduino to detect potential fire or flame presence. In this activity, the Arduino continuously reads input from the fire sensor and responds based on the detected value. When the sensor detects a possible fire, the system triggers an output such as an LED or alert to indicate a warning condition.

This activity introduces the concept of sensor-based input and conditional decision-making in Arduino programming. It helps demonstrate how real-world data from sensors can be processed by the microcontroller to produce meaningful responses. Through this exercise, students gain a better understanding of how sensors work, how input values are evaluated, and how Arduino can be used in basic safety or monitoring applications.
