This activity demonstrates how an Arduino and a Python program can work together to control hardware components using serial communication. In this setup, the Python program acts as the controller, sending simple text commands to the Arduino, while the Arduino responds by turning LEDs on or off based on the received commands. The activity emphasizes how software running on a computer can interact with a microcontroller in real time to control physical devices.

On the Arduino side, the program continuously monitors both the physical buttons and incoming serial data from Python. Each input—whether a button press or a character sent over serial—triggers a specific action, such as toggling the red, green, or blue LED, or turning all LEDs on or off. This structure keeps the program organized and allows the Arduino to respond quickly and accurately to different inputs.

The Python program handles communication with the Arduino by listening for button events and sending corresponding commands. It acts as a bridge between the user and the microcontroller, converting input into serial messages that the Arduino can interpret. When a command is received, the Arduino executes the appropriate LED action, updating the LED states immediately. This interaction illustrates the basics of serial communication, cross-language integration, and real-time hardware control.

Overall, this activity provides a practical example of how embedded systems and computer programs can work together. It teaches key concepts such as hardware-software interaction, event-driven programming, modular code structure, and the fundamentals of controlling physical devices from a software interface.
